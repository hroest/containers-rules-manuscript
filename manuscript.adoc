== Introduction

The ability to reproduce the original results of a scientific discovery has been one of the mayor challenges
in modern science. Evidences from multiple authors suggest that reproducibility in biomedical research is lower than 85%
cite:[pmid24411643], with 90% of researchers seeing science in reproducibility crisis cite:[pmid27225100].
One of the fundamental principles of reproducible science is accurate and
complete reporting of all experimental and computational steps required to
obtain the described results. This can be non-trivial especially for the
computational part of an analysis and the ability to exactly reproduce the
bioinformatics analysis, including the data processing and statistical
downstream analysis, is one of the major challenges in many scientific projects
cite:[pmid24204232]. Different authors have pointed out three main premises for reproducible bioinformatics software
deployment: (i) the use and documentation of exact versions of software and tools,
(ii) open source the code and all custom software,
(iii) adopt a licence and comply with third-party dependency licenses cite:[pmid28751965]+[pmid24204232].
Most of these work has been focussed in the openness and availability of the tools,
software, scripts and data to perform the
bioinformatics analysis cite:[pmid24204232]+[pmid27415786].

However, even if source code and data are published in a public repository (e.g
GitHub) alongside the paper as open source artifacts, they code may have
non-obvious dependencies on other software, configuration options, operating system 
and other subtleties that hamper straight forward re-usability.
cite:[Boettiger:2015:IDR:2723872.2723882]. The build, installation and deployment of scientific software solutions (e.g.
software or workflow) often requires internal knowledge that is missing in the published manuscript as well as the accompanying documentation. In addition, most of
the scientific software is developed by different teams but used in combination with workflows, scripts or pipelines.
This adds an additional layer of complexity introducing challenges such as compatibility and management of dependencies;
running serial and parallel processes; and working with a broad variety of software types and user-defined parameters.

Software containers have emerged as a powerful technology to document, distribute, and deploy scientific software and
workflows cite:[pmid28379341]. Containers are lightweight software components and libraries easily packaged designed to run
anywhere cite:[pmid28379341], thus useful to leverage bioinformatics software reproducibility. Conda packages and
Docker/Singularity containers are technologies applicable to the field of bioinformatics. By May 2018, the BioContainers
cite:[pmid28379341] and Bioconda cite:[207092] communities have released more than 4000 public containers facilitating the
development of complex and reproducible workflows and pipelines cite:[pmid28559010]+[pmid27137889].

This manuscript describes a core set of recommendations and guidelines to improve the quality and sustainability of
research software based on software packages and containers. It provides easy-to-implement recommendations that encourage
adoption of packaging (e.g. Conda) or containers (e.g. Docker, Singularity) technologies in bioinformatics and software
development for research. It provides recommendations about making research software and its source code more reproducible,
deployable, reusable, transparent and more compatible with other tools and software.

In this manuscript, software is broadly defined to include command line tools, graphical user interfaces, application program interfaces (APIs), infrastructure scripts and software packages (e.g. R packages).

== 1. One tool, one container.

Microservice and modular architectures cite:[7436659] provide a way of breaking large software projects into smaller,
independent, and loosely coupled modules. This software applications can be seen as a suite of independently deployable,
small, modular components in which each tool runs a *unique* process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight
mechanism to serve a business goal cite:[7436659]. Each of these independent modules are referred to as a _container_. A
container is essentially an encapsulated and immutable version of an application, coupled with the bare-minimum operating
system components (e.g. dependencies) required for execution cite:[pmid28379341].

Containers should be defined as granular as possible, with the premise _one Tool, one Container_. Each container should
encapsulate only one piece of software that performs a unique task with a well-defined goal (e.g. sequence aligner,
mass spectra identification).

== 2. A package first

A software package is self-contained software including all the dependencies libraries and packages necessary to execute
the software. Some of the most popular and well-known package distribution system are Homebrew
(https://brew.sh/[https://brew.sh]) and Conda (https://conda.io)[https://conda.io)] (todo: aren't apt and yum also very popular, if not more?). _Conda_, the most popular package
manager in research software, quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. It handles dependencies
for many languages such as C, C++, R, Java and of course Python tools.
~~ In addition, _Conda_ has joined to other popular
packages manager systems such as Gentoo, BSD Ports, MacPorts, and Homebrew which build packages from source instead of
installing from a pre-built binary. ~~
The field of computational biology has built an strong community around
(Bioconda)[https://bioconda.github.io)].

Bioconda is a channel for the Conda package manager specialised in bioinformatics software. You can create a _Conda_
package by defining a _BioConda_ recipe (**Box 1**). This recipe
(https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes[https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes]) includes enough information
about the dependencies, the LICENSE and fundamental metadata to find, retrieve and use the package
(see *Recomendation 10*). Each package added to Bioconda is also made available as a Docker container via Quay.io, as a
Singularity container and
displayed in the BioContainers registry cite:[pmid28379341]. The BioContainers registry displays Docker containers as well
as containers from other technologies such as rkt and Singularity cite:[pmid28494014] making easier to find a discover
packages and related containers.

== 3. Tool and container versions should be explicit

The tool or software wrapped inside the container should be fixed explicitly to a defined version through the mechanism
available by the package manager used (**Box 2**). The version used for this main software should be
included in both, the metadata of the container (for ease of identification) and the container tag. The tag and metadata of
the container should also include a versioning number for the container itself, meaning that the tag could look
like `&lt;version-of-the-tool&gt;_cv&lt;version-of-the-container&gt;`. The container version, which does not track the tool
changes but the container, should follow semantic versioning to signal its backward compatibility.

(todo: could we use an example that uses an stock image, at an explicit version, and where the container has been versioned using semantic versioning? I have many few examples.)
```

Box 2: BioContainers recipe for comet software. The metadata container the license of the software.

If a copy is done via `git clone` or equivalent, a specific commit or a tagged
version should be specified, never a branch only. Cloning a branch (master,
develop, etc) will use always the latest code in that branch making impossible
to reproduce the build process since different code will be built as soon as
the branch is updated by the software authors.  Upstream authors should be
asked to create a stable version of their software with reasonable guarantees
that the specified version works as advertise including passing all automated
tests -- this will often be a _release_ version. Any patches added on top of
the official released code should be clearly indicated. For projects that
practice agile software development (including continuous integration) where
each version is stable, tested and works as advertised, the SVN or git
identifier should be used as the tool version for the container -- possibly
with addition of a date in YYYYMMDD format to easily identify newer versions
from older versions. 

== 4. Avoid using ENTRYPOINT

It is a well-known feature of Docker that the entry-point of the container can be over-written by definition
(e.g, ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/ping"]). The **ENTRYPOINT** specifies a command that will always be executed when the container
starts. Even when the ENTRYPOINT helps the user to get s _default_ behaviour for a tool, it is not recommended because of
reproducibility concerns of the implicit hidden execution point. By explicitly executing the tool by its executable inside the
container (using the container as an environment and not as a fat binary merely through its ENTRYPOINT) the user (e.g.
workflow) can recognize and trace which tool is used within the container.

== 5. Relevant tools and software should be executable and in the PATH

// TODO this may be merged with the point above (4)
If for some reason the container needs to expose more than a single executable or script
(for instance, EMBOSS or other packages with many executables), these should always be executable and be available in the
container's default PATH. This will be mostly always the case by default for everything that is installed via a package
manager (dpkg, yum, pip, etc.), but if you are adding tailored made scripts or installing by source, take care of adding
the executables to the PATH. This will facilitate the use of the container as an environment (rule 4) or to specify
alternative commands to the main entrypoint easily.

== 6. Reduce the size of your container as much as possible

Since containers are being constantly being pushed and pulled over the internet, their size matters.
There are many tips to reduce the size of your container in build time:

  - Avoid installing "recommended" packages in apt based systems.
  - Do not keep build tools in the image: this includes compilers and development libraries that will seldomly, if not at
    all, used in runtime when your container is being used by others. For instance, packages like gcc can use several
    hundred megabytes. This also applies to tools like git, wget or curl, which you might have used to retrieve software
    during container build time, but are not needed for runtime.
  - Make sure you clean caches, unneeded downloads and temporary files.
  - In Dockerfiles, combine multiple RUNs so that the initial packages installations and the final deletions (of compilers,
    development libraries and caches/temporary files) are left within the same layer.
  - If installing or cloning from a git repositories, use shallow clones, which for large repos will save a lot of space.
    (todo: the git repo is deleted in the same step, right? So why shallow clones? - there are many tools that don't provide
    an installation process (Galaxy for instance), so for some of them the installation might be just a git clone. Also, using
    shallow clones will reduce download times during build time for large projects.)

== 7. Choose a base image wisely.

// TODO this may be merged with the point above (6)
One of the decisions that will most likely impact on your final container image size will be your base image. If you can,
start with a lightweight base image such as Alpine or similar, always using a fixed version and not the latest tag. If installing your software on
top of such a minimal operating system doesn't work out well, only then use a larger OS where installation of
the software tool might be simpler (such as Ubuntu). Preferring stock base images means that many other people will be using
them and that your container will be pulled faster, as shared layers are more likely. Always aim to have predefined images
from where you choose (for example, always the same Alpine version as first choice and always the same Ubuntu version as second choice), so that most of your containers share the same base image.

== 8. Add functional testing logic

If others want to build locally your container, want to rebuild it later on with an updated base image, want to integrate
it to a continuous integration system or for many other reasons, users might want to test that the built
container still serves the function for which it was originally designed. For this it is useful to add some
testing logic to the container (in the form of a bash script for instance) in a standard location
(here we propose a file called `runTest.sh`, executable and in the path) which includes all the logic for:

    - Installing any packages that might be needed for testing, such as wget for instance to retrieve example files for the
      run.
    - Obtain sample files for testing, which might be for instance an example data set from a reference archive.
    - Run the software that the container wraps with that data to produce and output inside the container.
    - Compare the produced output and exit with an error code if the comparison is not successful.

The file containing testing logic is not meant to be executed during container build time, so the retrieved data and/or
packages do not increase the size of the container when it is being built. This means that,
because the file is inside the container, any user who has built the container or downloaded the container image can check
that the container is working adequately by executing `runTest.sh` inside the container.

== 9. Check the license of the software

When adding software or data in a container, always check their license. A free to use license is not always free to
distribute or copy. License _must_ always be explicitly defined in your Docker labels and depending on license,
you must also include a copy of the license with the software. Same care must be applied to included data.
If license is not specified, you should ask the upstream author to provide a license.

== 10. Make you package or container discoverable

Biomedical research and bioinformatics demands more efforts to make bioinformatics software and data more discoverable,
Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR Principles) cite:[pmid26978244]. Leveraging those principles, we recommend to
the bioinformatics community and software developers to make their containers and package more findable. In order to make
your package available we recommend the following steps:

  - Annotate packages and containers with metadata that allows users (e.g. biologists and bioinformatians) to find them.
  - Make packages and containers available. We recommend developers make the recipe of how to build a container available
    for others, including i) the source code or binaries of the original tools; ii)
    the configuration settings and test data.
  - Register packages and container in existing bioinformatics registries helping users and services to find them.
    Registries such as BioContainers cite:[pmid28379341], bio.tools cite:[pmid26538599] and Bioconda cite:[207092] do
    collaborate exchanging metadata and information using different APIs and a common identifier system.
  - Deposit the built container image in a public container registry, such as Dockerhub, Quay.io or a publicly available
    and well supported institutional registry for container images.

== 11. Provide reproducible builds

While docker containers strive to make research reproducible and transparent,
it is equally important that the process of creating and building the docker
containers themselves is transparent and reproducible.  Many docker containers
do not provide an associated Dockerfile, which would allow an independent party
to reproduce the container build independently. Other build procedures rely on
the presence of specific web resources, download binary files from the internet
or can only be built with in-house resources that are not available to the
public.  Furthermore, a poorly documented build process makes it harder to
provide updated versions of the tool itself, leading people to rely on outdated
versions of a tool or (in the worst case) the possibility of undetected
tampering with the source code. We therefore recommend to provide clearly
documented steps on how to generate all the binaries directly from the source
code. This relates to the distributed docker image but also the base image used
and the procedure to generate any binary file that gets added to the container
(preferably these files will be generated through a multi-stage build or in a
different container whose Dockerfile is also available).

== 12. Document the build files

Adding documentation to Dockerfiles will allow the author as well as users to
understand the build process and modify it their needs. This means describing
the rationale for each RUN step and advising the user where additional
information can be obtained. If a certain resource may not be easily available
or consists of a binary file, provide additional instructions on how to
re-create this resource (e.g. a link to a second Docker file that creates the
resource).

== Conclusions

This manuscript promotes and encourages adoption of package/container technologies to improve the quality and reusability of research software. The recommendations share a set of core views that are summarised below:

  * _Simplicity_: the encapsulated software should not be a complex environment of dependencies, tools and scripts.
  * _Maintainability_: the more software is included to the container the harder it is to maintain it, especially when the
    software comes from difference sources.
  * _Sustainability_: the developers of the software should be engaged or made aware to support the sustainability of the
    container.
  * _Reusability_: a tool container should be safe to reuse by any other workflow component or task through its access
    interface.
  * _Interoperability_: different tools should be easy to connect and exchange information.
  * _User’s acceptability_: tool container should encapsulate domain business process units, so it can be easier to check
    and use.
  * _Size_: Containers should be as small as possible. Smaller containers are much quicker to download and therefore they
    can be distributed to different machines much quicker.
  * _Transparency_: Containers should be transparent in how they were built, which tasks they are designed to perform and 
    how the build process can be reproduced.

For users involved in scientific research and bioinformatics interested in this topic without experience working with
software packages or containers, we recommend to explore and engage with the BioContainers initiative cite:[pmid28379341].
As with many tools, a learning curve lays ahead, but several basic yet powerful features are accessible even to the
beginner and may be applied to many different use-cases. To conclude, we would like to recommend some examples of
bioinformatics containers in BioContainers (Table 1) and some useful training materials, including workshops, online
courses, and manuscripts (Table 2).
